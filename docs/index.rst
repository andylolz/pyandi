Welcome to pyandi's documentation!
==================================

pyandi is a toolkit for using `IATI data <https://iatistandard.org/>`__. It includes a `query
language <https://erikbern.com/2018/08/30/i-dont-want-to-learn-your-garbage-query-language.html>`__
wrapper around `XPath <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath>`__, with
some IATI-related helpers included.

The name is a homage to its predecessor,
`pyIATI <https://github.com/IATI/pyIATI>`__.
